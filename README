# Jira Security Scheme Group Removal Script

This script is used to remove groups from issue security scheme levels in Jira Cloud using the Jira REST API.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Required Python packages: `csv` and `requests`

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code.

   Create a virtual environment by running the following command:

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   This will create a new directory named `venv` that contains the virtual environment.

   Activate the virtual environment by running the appropriate command based on your operating system:

   - For Windows:

     ```
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - For macOS/Linux:

     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

Once activated, you will see `(venv)` in your terminal prompt.

2. Install the required Python packages by running the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Open the `script.py` file in a text editor.

4. Update the following variables with your Jira Cloud details:

- `api_url`: The URL of your Jira Cloud REST API endpoint.
- `username`: Your Jira username.
- `api_token`: Your Jira API token.

5. Save the changes to the `script.py` file.

## Usage

1. Prepare a CSV file with the list of groups to be removed from the security scheme levels. The CSV file should have the following columns:

- `memberId`: The ID of the group to be removed.
- `scheme_id`: The ID of the security scheme.
- `level_id`: The ID of the security scheme level.

Example CSV file content:
memberId,scheme_id,level_id group1,123,456 group2,789,012

2. Place the CSV file in the same directory as the `script.py` file.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `script.py` file.

4. Run the script using the following command:

    ```bash
    python script.py
    ```

The script will read the CSV file and remove the specified groups from the corresponding security scheme levels in Jira Cloud.

5. Check the output in the terminal to see the status of group removal. Successful removals will be indicated, and any failures will be reported.

6. Customize the script as needed for your specific requirements.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues or errors, please refer to the error messages displayed in the terminal for troubleshooting guidance.

- Ensure that you have a stable internet connection and that the provided Jira Cloud URL, username, and API token are correct.

- Make sure that the CSV file is properly formatted and contains the required columns.
